// GUIDE
- You need to set up on the sandbox and [create](https://sandbox.africastalking.com/ussd/createchannel) a USSD channel that you will use to test by dialing into it via our [simulator](https://simulator.africastalking.com:1517/).

- Assuming that you are doing your development on a localhost, you have to expose your application living in the webroot of your localhost to the internet via a tunneling application like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
